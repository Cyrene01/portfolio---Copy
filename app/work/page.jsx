      Optical fibers are primarily classified into single-mode and multi-mode fibers based on how they transmit light. Single-mode fibers allow only one light mode to propagate, making them ideal for long-distance and high-speed communication due to minimal signal distortion. Multi-mode fibers, on the other hand, permit multiple light modes to travel through the core, which makes them more suitable for short-distance applications like local networks. Based on materials, optical fibers can be glass or plastic. Glass fibers, made of high-purity silica, are used for most telecommunications because of their low signal loss and durability, while plastic fibers are cheaper and easier to handle but are limited to short-range uses. There are also variations in core design, such as step-index fibers, which have a sharp refractive index difference, and graded-index fibers, where the refractive index changes gradually to reduce signal distortion. Each type of optical fiber is designed for specific applications, offering flexibility and efficiency in data transmission.
