      The history of optical fiber dates back to the 19th century when John Tyndall demonstrated how light could travel through a stream of water, hinting at the principles of guiding light. By the 1920s, the concept of using glass fibers to transmit light began to take shape, and in the 1950s, practical developments started with flexible fibers that could carry images. Narinder Singh Kapany, known as the father of fiber optics, played a key role in refining these early ideas.

A major breakthrough occurred in the 1960s when Charles Kao and George Hockham proposed that high-purity glass fibers could transmit light signals over long distances with minimal loss. Kaoâ€™s work, which earned him a Nobel Prize, laid the foundation for modern optical communication. In 1970, Corning Glass Works developed the first low-loss optical fiber, making the technology practical for real-world use. Around the same time, the invention of lasers provided a reliable light source for transmitting data.

By the 1980s, optical fibers were being deployed in telecommunications networks, replacing copper wires due to their superior speed, bandwidth, and reliability. Today, optical fibers are a cornerstone of global communication, enabling high-speed internet, advanced medical imaging, and countless other technologies, reflecting decades of innovation and development.
