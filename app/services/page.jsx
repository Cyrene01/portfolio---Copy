Optical fibers are thin strands of glass or plastic used to transmit light signals over long distances with minimal loss. They work on the principle of total internal reflection, where light travels through the fiber core by bouncing off the surrounding cladding. These fibers consist of a core for transmitting light, a cladding layer that keeps the light contained, and a protective outer coating. Optical fibers are widely used in telecommunications, providing faster and more efficient data transfer compared to traditional copper cables. They are also immune to electromagnetic interference, making them ideal for secure communication. Beyond telecommunications, they are used in medical devices like endoscopes, sensors, and industrial applications. Their ability to handle high bandwidth has revolutionized internet connectivity and global communication. With ongoing advancements, optical fibers continue to shape the future of technology and communication systems.
