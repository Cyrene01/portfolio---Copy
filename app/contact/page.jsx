    Recent advancements in optical fiber technology have focused on improving data transmission speed, capacity, and reliability. Space Division Multiplexing (SDM) is a cutting-edge approach that uses multiple cores within a single fiber, significantly increasing data capacity. The development of hollow-core fibers, which guide light through air rather than solid glass, reduces latency and energy loss. Photonics-based sensors integrated into optical fibers are now used for precise monitoring in industries like healthcare and aerospace. Enhanced fiber amplifiers and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technologies allow for higher data transmission rates over longer distances. Advances in fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) networks are enabling ultra-fast internet speeds. Additionally, quantum communication through optical fibers is paving the way for ultra-secure data transfer. Research in biocompatible fibers has also opened up applications in medical diagnostics and treatments. These innovations continue to drive the evolution of optical fiber technology in modern communication and beyond.
